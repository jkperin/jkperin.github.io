# Lecture notes

1. [Introduction](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/01_introduction.pdf)

    > A short review of signals and systems, convolution, discrete-time Fourier transform, and the _z_-transform.

2. [Discrete-time random signals](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/02_discrete-time_random_signals.pdf)

    > Theory on random signals and their importance in modeling complicated signals.

3. [Linear and time-invariant systems](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/03_properties_of_lti_systems.pdf)

    >Linear and time-invariant (LTI) systems are a particularly important class of systems. They're the systems for which convolution holds. We review their most important properties and how to analyze them.

4. [Sampling and resconstruction](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/04_sampling_reconstruction.pdf)

    >The mathmatical formulation of sampling and reconstruction.

5. [Resampling](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/05_resampling.pdf)

    >How to change the sampling rate of digital signals.

6. [Quantization](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/06_quantization.pdf)

    >How to model quantization and its effects on digital systems.

7. [Digital filter structures](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/07_digital_filter_structures.pdf)

    >How to implement digital filters based on their difference equation.

8. [Quantization in filter structures](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/08_quantization_in_filter_structures.pdf)

    >Effect of fix-point operations in digital filter, how to analyze it, and how to minimize its effects.

9. [Filter design](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/09_filter_design.pdf)

    >Filter design of infinite impulse response (IIR) and finite impulse response (FIR) filters.

10. [Adaptive signal processing](https://github.com/jkperin/ee264/tree/master/docs/lectures/10_adaptive_signal_processing.pdf)

    >Introdcution to adpative signal processing using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm.

    >Recap of the most important concepts covered throughout the course.
